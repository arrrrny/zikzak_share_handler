# Specification Quality Checklist: Publishing Scripts and macOS Platform Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. The spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- Key technical findings from codebase analysis are documented in assumptions to guide implementation planning:
  - macOS pubspec.yaml incorrectly declares `ios` platform instead of `macos` (line 23)
  - macOS implementation is a stub with only `getPlatformVersion`
  - `SharedAttachment.decode` only handles URI decoding for iOS, needs macOS support
  - Main package has macOS and other platforms commented out in pubspec.yaml
